## Project Overview
DataOrbit has been contracted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to build an intelligent fraud-detection system capable of identifying high-risk healthcare providers in the U.S. Medicare system. Healthcare fraud costs the system more than $68 billion annually, and current rule-based methods fail to catch sophisticated schemes.

**Goal:** Develop an end-to-end, interpretable machine-learning pipeline that detects potentially fraudulent providers from multi-table Medicare claims data while handling severe class imbalance (~10 % fraudulent providers) and minimizing false positives.

### Types of Fraud Targeted
- Billing for services not rendered  
- Upcoding & unbundling  
- Claims for deceased patients  
- Unnecessary treatments and kickback schemes
