RAW DATASET (too large for GitHub)

Download the original dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis

After downloading and unzipping, place these 4 files in this folder:

• Train_Beneficiarydata-1542865627584.csv
• Train_Inpatientdata-1542865627584.csv
• Train_Outpatientdata-1542865627584.csv
• Train-1542865627584.csv  (this is the fraud labels)

The notebooks use relative paths ../data/ so they will work immediately once you add the files locally.
